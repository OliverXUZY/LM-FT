0,"weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; . it does n 't show the complete file names of mp3s with really long names ; . you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc . ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] ."
0,many of our disney movies do n 't play on this dvd player .
0,player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .
0,"i know the saying is "" you get what you pay for "" but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse ."
0,will never purchase apex again .
0,customer service and technical support are overloaded and non responsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them .

0,new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays .

0,have had problems since the first day
0,"- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it ."
0,it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation .

0,"the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with "" canned air . """
0,"the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons ."
0,"i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed ."
0,i also did n 't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode .
0,"the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings ."

0,i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n 't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .
0,wo n 't play a lot of discs .

0,it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .
0,the dvd player does not work properly .
0,"the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd ."
0,"this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before ."
0,"after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( flor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them . the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support ."

0,on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .

0,door broke after a month .
0,unit took forever since the beginning to recognize and play discs .
0,3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything .
0,"after @ 3 months , it stopped playing higher number scenes on dvds ."
0,"as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale ."
0,only used for 3 month before it 's down ! .
0,"it sends discontinuous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment ."
0,the other thing i do n 't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .
0,the entire unit was poorly crafted .
0,there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board .
0,"after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it ."
0,the dvd player just would 't recognize them .
0,"it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc ."
0,i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disappointed ! .
0,they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy .
0,now i know why - they are pieces of junk .
0,"less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows "" no disc . """
0,same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing .
0,this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared .
0,apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy .
0,this dvd play is basically junk .
0,it wo n 't play all of my movies .
0,"i tried called apex cu st service , no help ."
0,"mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs ."
0,each of the 4 lasted less than six months .
0,i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n 't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) .
0,"one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does ."
0,"i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad ."
0,the first one would n 't work from the start .
0,the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out ! .
0,"i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n 't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy ."
0,"but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on it have a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventually the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments ."
0,we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .
0,there was neither picture nor sound .
0,i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual .
0,it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n 't the only one this happened to . )
0,"i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal ."
0,neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i 've been waiting 27 days . )
0,"it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen ."
0,"i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) ."
0,"it would just spin up and stop , and display "" no disc "" ."
0,"my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units ."
0,you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll .
0,"also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 "" tv ) ."
0,"and the remote is cheap and ch easy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck ! ."
0,after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty .
0,i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc .
0,i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable .
0,i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered .
0,it has never worked .
0,"i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still can 't get a video signal from the machine ."
0,purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it .
0,the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .
0,they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply .
0,i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response .
0,3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze .
0,now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk .
0,"have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital . com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid ."
0,"have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo ) , but can 't get through ."
0,"this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks ."
0,"after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd ."
0,i can only hear the sound but no picture ! .
0,their customer ( www . apex digital inc . com ) service is very poor .
0,one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing .
0,some dvd 's i rented would not play .
0,"when the player was working it was great , but ."
0,"first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed ."
0,what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .
0,"for example , i tried playing my new "" pirates of the caribbean "" extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it ."
0,"at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my "" alias "" dvds as well ."
0,"because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product ."
0,after two weeks the picture kept freezing .
0,apex sucks ! .
0,unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed .
0,"the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie "" extras "" on them on the two occasions when i tried to do that ."
0,the remote is a little hard to understand .
0,"my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 "" screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 "" monitor ."
0,video output stopped working .
0,"this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) ."
0,what a disappointment ! .
0,there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n 't moving in time to the dialog ) .
0,"but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working ."
0,"output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold ."
0,p . s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ? .
0,what the hell is wrong with this thing .
0,forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds .
0,"well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) ."
0,"so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it ! ."
0,"the first one we installed did n 't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least ."
0,update : january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product ! .
0,i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds .
0,"after multiple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available ."
0,only one disk played through to completion successfully .
0,"when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door ."
0,"when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn "" t work either ! ."
0,imagine my shock - and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex .
0,the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .
0,the ad-1600 did n 't work correctly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .
0,"the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ah wile ."
0,"we tried the "" finding memo "" dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason ."
0,i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .
0,only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon .
0,"the player kept displaying "" no disc "" , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * ! ."
0,"1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , "" dad ! . somethings wrong with the dvd player ! . come quick ! . """
0,"2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong ."
0,5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control .
0,finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .
0,"one still works fine , the other quit after one day ."
0,apex 's website is down and they wo n 't answer their phone .
0,it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .
0,"when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture ! ."
0,"seemed like a good deal , but this pps frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes , "" no disc "" ."
0,"granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player ."
0,"first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds ."
0,this is extremely lame .
0,the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use .
0,"in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it ."
0,"after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift ."
0,"it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches ."
0,"both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going ."
0,one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .
0,the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .
0,"all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing creepiness of this very embarassing gift ."
0,"i was impressed by this very inexpensive player . for the first three hours , and then it died ."
0,"there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my perv . machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance ."
0,i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes ! .
0,i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n 't do it ! .
0,"i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n 't work ! ."
0,"unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds . even though they were not damaged in any way ."
0,i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing .
0,"the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n 't see on a sony and an overall plastic feel"
0,"remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons ."
0,the one i purchased for a friend as a gift will not read any dvd disc .
0,"however , it has failed to deliver on quality ."
0,"it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies ."
0,"on several different occasions it has displayed "" no disc "" with a disc inside ."
0,"i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product ."
0,the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .
0,"however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my dix rips ."
0,"can 't say whether i rec 'd an "" updated "" model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me ."
0,* main dial is not backlit .
0,* lens visible in optical viewfinder .
0,"the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me ."
0,"the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial . its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n 't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )"
0,"1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectors s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contracted mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )"
0,2 ) not very ergonomically - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )
0,4 ) the viewfinder is bordered lcd skying .
0,the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
0,the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .
0,"b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens ti gt and cause potential damage ."
0,"the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy ."
0,"maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing ."
0,it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
0,"sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan 't up to the task ."
0,i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .
0,the grain was terrible .
0,"well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise ."
0,"the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash ."
0,"relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots ."
0,"now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 ! ."
0,"the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera ."
0,what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
0,about the only legitimate criticism from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
0,the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
0,got way too many blurry pictures .
0,"the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots ."
0,it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .
0,canon 's g3 does it consistently .
0,"it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot ."
0,"unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted ."
0,1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .
0,"2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic ."
0,it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
0,"one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all ."
0,you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
0,"( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format ."
0,it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ? .
0,"one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough ."
0,the included memory card is too small .
0,it is made of plastic .
0,the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .
0,"while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets ."
0,the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .
0,"flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get over illuminated main subjects with depth being lost ."
0,the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .
0,"yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n 't like it too but no harm done since i always use the cam ea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n 't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; . that is what lamest exactly ot the picture ."
0,"to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; . however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder ."
0,this camera has a major design flaw .
0,when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .
0,"i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better ."
0,"the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera ."
0,"and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 ."
0,"the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots ."
0,"i thought given all the "" 10 "" reviews about this camera that i would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey ."
0,i did see the review here and other places about a cracked lcd screen .
0,"when i went to put in the new sd card i looked at the lcd screen -- cracked -- and the fluid gave a jackson pollock type appearance to the screen , black and blue and purple blotches and streaks -- useless ."
0,some more manual control would have been nice .
0,the only knock i have is that the flash is underpowered .
0,"after reading reviews of lcd problems , cracked , black blobs etc , i figured that it was probably a very limited problem ."
0,after 57 pictures total the lcd went black except for the icons showing the settings .
0,you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight camera shake is a problem to contend with .
0,"the disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures , especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can ."
0,i would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature .
0,also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls .
0,battery life is not long enough if and only if you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times . . . the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it 's normal .
0,the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera .
0,only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash .
0,"the sd500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months , and the lcd has been broken twice ."
0,i took it out one day and the lcd was not working .
0,"although the sd500 takes great quality photos , the sensitivity of the lcd compromises the quality overall ."
0,"i also own a canon digital rebel and i agree that the advanced controls on the sd500 are not as robust , but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the digital rebel ."
0,the only problem i have with the buttons is that the power button and print/share button don 't have a nice click .
0,the buttons are rather stiff .
0,some adjustments in the settings could help make it better .
0,i thought this camera was awful and i did tons of research on cnet and other sites .
0,there were many times when i clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens .
0,"the controls are hard to manipulate , especially in the dark ."
0,the lcd screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones .
0,the only thing i don 't like is the small size ( 8 meg ) memory card that comes with it .
0,"i have to move pictures off of it every day so i have room for more pictures the next , and i don 't have enough money to buy the 256 meg card that i 've had my eye on for a while ."
0,a larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy .
0,"other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as i 'd like them ,"
0,"first off , the battery ."
0,"this camera uses a lithium battery , i find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient ; . because what if you are on vacation , where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station -- there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there ."
0,"not only is it inconvenient , but also the battery life span is short ."
0,"this isn 't uncommon in cameras , though , just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries , you should be fine ."
0,another problem i had with this camera was the zoom function .
0,such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in . . . wrong ! .
0,the zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet .
0,"even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little , resulting in a noisy start-up ."
0,the flash is very weak .
0,the last problem i found with this camera was the macro function .
0,the auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject .
0,"to make matters work , there is no manual override to overcome this problem ."
0,"it 's not my first choice in cameras ,"
0,1 ) it is perhaps too small .
0,i find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on .
0,its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge ( not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips ) .
0,2 ) the delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots .
0,this is due to the unusually slow autofocus system .
0,"3 ) the lack of an intermediate resolution setting , as other reviewers have suggested , is a problem , but that problem is meaningless with a larger compactflash memory card"
0,4 ) the camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away .
0,it is hot enough to be annoying .
0,i left the camera in my car in maine ( not a very hot place ) and the lcd screen cracked ! .
0,i then realized a major design flaw .
0,all the camera 's functionality is only available ( or selectable ) when the screen is functional .
0,"when the screen stops working , you 're out of luck ! ."
0,the viewfinder does not accurately represent the picture being taken .
0,the digital zoom is crap .
0,the pictures are a little dark sometimes .
0,the movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160x120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640x480 .
0,the price is $ . . . more .
0,i originally gave this camera 5 stars . when i had windows 98 it was wonderful but i got a new computer last november with xp the usb software is soho . . . not compatible with xp
0,the new drivers on cannon 's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software .
0,the adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with xp so you are forced to create your document then either print it from windows or export it to another application .
0,"the only thing i don 't like about it is that you have to buy a larger memory card , first thing ! ."
0,my only complaint and the reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren 't as intuitive as they should be .
0,"i 've often struggled to get something to work the way i want it , and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time ! ."
0,"all that said , i am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera ."
0,"when taking pictures of people , however , it shows every flaw in the subject 's skin ."
0,other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better .
0,i will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture .
0,i 'd give it 5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes .
0,"for example , in auto mode you can 't use the flash redeye reduction , you must be in manual mode for that ."
0,the auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds .
0,the dynamic range seems not quite as good as the kodak dc260 .
0,"8- buttons are little , but if you have steady fingers and deal ed with a casio worst calculator watch , you can deal with almost anything ."
0,"buttons size is ok for me , my wife , but not my granny ."
0,"sometimes the pictures are on the dark side , but i 'm able to fix that using the photoshop 6 . 0 "" adjust levels "" function . . . not sure how a person would do that without photoshop , though ."
0,"only 1 problem , no accessories . . . yet ."
0,"i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard ."
0,"you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck"
0,navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .
0,"it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to ."
0,"the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n 't come in the overused blue ."
0,"it does n 't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n 't generally have firewire cards themselves ."
0,"the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks ."
0,"the only downside i see is that it does n 't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer ."
0,the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .
0,"the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use ."
0,the player itself has all sorts of problems .
0,"the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so ."
0,"the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset ."
0,the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; . not sensitive enough at others .
0,depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .
0,the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .
0,"overall , a very disappointing product ."
0,"the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par ."
0,the player 's mechanics are also flawed .
0,"although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product ."
0,"one beef is the scroll , it does n 't work as well as i 'd like ."
0,deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ) .
0,getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .
0,"also , the instruction manual is very bad ."
0,transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1 . 1 or 2 . 0 .
0,"it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error ."
0,"scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling ."
0,size - bigger than the ipod
0,"software - music match jukebox is n 't the greatest , the search function is n 't fast even when accessing it with the hot key shortcut ."
0,"all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n 't done it since ."
0,"first , the cons . . . a tad bulky . . . not the most aesthetic looking player . . . and does n 't support a folder structure ."
0,the cons are n 't really a big deal to me . . . except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files . . . no folder structure . . . and it 's based on the title of the songs . . . many of my songs where separated into folders ( on the pc ) . . . and a few had same titles . . . so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n 't have any that might be the same as another .
0,and man . . . i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player . . . because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title . .
0,the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
0,"my "" fast forward "" button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go ."
0,"sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much ."
0,"unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks ."
0,"if you do n 't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders ."
0,i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n 't a big problem .
0,"the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n 't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again ."
0,the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .
0,the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n 't figure out a way to break it .
0,i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .
0,"i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment ."
0,- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
0,the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use .
0,the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
0,- included creative software is pretty poor .
0,"i tried to play the song three times , with no success ."
0,"it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk ."
0,"had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches ."
0,this product is too fragile for normal use .
0,"however , the creative software is not real intuitive ."
0,"the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest ."
0,"if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly ."
0,this is ridiculous .
0,"the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks ."
0,seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .
0,the interface used could be better designed .
0,it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .
0,"and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control ."
0,"it is some protection for the unit , but for use ability , forget it ."
0,"the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel ."
0,however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
0,"quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time ."
0,"i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year "" no questions asked "" replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous ! ."
0,"1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more ."
0,"2 . the scroll button is n 't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select ."
0,i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
0,1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )
0,2 ) scroll button / switch
0,3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .
0,but for now it appears that this player does n 't play well with itunes .
0,the scroll bar is a bit of a pain .
0,i was a little disappointed in the low end .
0,the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .
0,"in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders ."
0,"you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division ."
0,"the software , which comes with player is not good at all ."
0,i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .
0,"so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly ."
0,this thing is trash .
0,"a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop"
0,b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
0,c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said
0,"d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on"
0,e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage
0,"f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the aesthetics bit down , of course"
0,the software failed repeatedly .
0,creative labs customer support website is useless .
0,software downloads on the site crashed my pc .
0,it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .
0,"another irrigation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on ."
0,"the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) ."
0,on my main computer the software did not work right .
0,i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .
0,"the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )"
0,"yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them ."
0,1 ) a spare battery would have been great .
0,2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .
0,"3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players"
0,navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .
0,fm receiver - it has none .
0,cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .
0,"the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive ."
0,"as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable ."
0,the songs do n 't play one after another like on a cd .
0,software - the software is crap .
0,"otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward ."
0,"even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out ."
0,"no line out jack - as i said , there is none ."
0,"it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack ."
0,controls are a bit awkward .
0,it was n 't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .
0,crappy headphones .
0,the included earbuds were uncomfortable .
0,"difficult navigation - i wo n 't necessarily say "" difficult , "" but i do n 't enjoy the scroll wheel to navigate ."
0,"it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly ."
0,i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
0,"up , down , left , and right would have given me better control ."
0,"if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get "" stuck "" rapidly going through the songs and wo n 't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it ."
0,"it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n 't cover up the ac jack ."
0,"as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand ."
0,but the major problem i had was with the software .
0,the instructions that come with it do n 't explain how to make things simple .
0,the quick sync is n 't any good because it either needs to be configured properly or just is n 't very useful .
0,i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
0,"the headphones are n 't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity ."
0,creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n 't as easy as i would have liked .
0,my only significant complaint is sound quality .
0,the eax sound enhancement feature did n 't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
0,"i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with "" bass boost . """
0,"well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze ."
0,my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n 't have them .
0,"a little weighty ( 9 ounces . . . no biggie ) , but otherwise fine ."
0,but the earbuds suck ! .
0,"i forgot , the case does n 't fit ."
0,"my case doesnt close . . . maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great ."
0,what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .
0,"bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature . . . but not on this player . . ."
0,"rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . ."
0,this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks . . .
0,"the dynamic playlists ( "" now playing "" , i be live creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate . . ."
0,"the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price ."
0,"loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well ."
0,my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .
0,other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .
0,"also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore "" the "" when it lists the cds in alphabetical order ."
0,"finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order ."
0,only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .
0,"the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n 't as easy as the ipod 's , or as "" sexy "" looking ."
0,as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away ! .
0,"the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid ."
0,"the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal ."
0,"it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it ."
0,i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .
0,its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .
0,"its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n 't since with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , etc . like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) ."
0,it also has unproven battery life .
0,"finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best ."
0,* protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window .
0,* scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models .
0,* eax equalizer accentuates diminished quality of mp3 files .
0,"* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ) ."
0,* software is absolutely terrible :
0,"-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ) ."
0,"-- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library ."
0,-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .
0,-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
0,"my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the dds service , the ripping process fails to populate the "" year "" field ."
0,"navigation could be better , but there is n 't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it ."
0,"the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with ."
0,"however , i do n 't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n 't secure and the case can slip off ."
0,"also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display ."
0,this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; . and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .
0,"1 . creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; . but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; . 3 , 400 tracks ; . 12 . 5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ? ."
0,mediasource did not recognize my tags ! .
1,im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button ! .
1,"but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it ! ."
1,it practically plays almost everything you give it .
1,for the price it is a well spent investment ! .
1,"this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways ."
1,"it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set ."
1,its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .
1,"it plays alternate video formats ( cads , svcds , cods ) very well ."
1,and amazon . com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ? .
1,"what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e . , mp3s ) ."
1,it sure does ! .
1,that 's a rare and valuable feature .
1,"another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying ."
1,"at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast ! ."
1,"update : the finish is more "" mirror "" than silver -- and i like it ! ."
1,player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .
1,"for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised ."
1,i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites .
1,i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .
1,have used it frequently and have had no problems .
1,i liked this one enough to buy another .
1,my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money .
1,great quality picture and features .
1,it looks great - and is loaded with features .
1,the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me .
1,"i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it ."
1,"( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . )"
1,"the fact that this model would play jpeg slide shows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting ."
1,"while i would like to give it 3 . 5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it ."
1,"nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have ."
1,we tried it out christmas night and it worked great .
1,even viewed cds full of jogs .
1,"well , it was nice while it lasted ."
1,"this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cmdr / cadre / dvd / dvd , and of course plays dvd movies from uk . i love the giff , progressive scan feature ."
1,"because of it 's hidden features ( no macro vision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's ."
1,"the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's ."
1,"it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video ."
1,i find this to be a great feature .
1,i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great .
1,for the money apex machines have good features .
1,"it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice ."
1,i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy .
1,"i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vb files which i created with smart ripper ."
1,the af feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal .
1,loved the slim design .
1,audio is excellent .
1,i am very pleased with the apex ad2600 . it plays just about anything you put in the drawer .
1,"but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n 't anticipate any problems with it ."
1,simple to use and hook up .
1,the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used .
1,this is the best dvd player i 've purchased .
1,"this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong ."
1,"well , this apex dvd player turned out great ! ."
1,"it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n 't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player ! ."
1,"i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds ."
1,i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .
1,and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey ! .
1,"finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me ! ."
1,for the most part this is a good dvd player .
1,we are overall pleased with product .
1,"progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) ."
1,"seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) ."
1,"also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and br mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) ."
1,"output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv ."
1,"i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box ."
1,i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch wide screen dvd 's to normal .
1,looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .
1,this thing plays everything i feed it .
1,when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n 't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .
1,"easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot ."
1,it does n 't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive .
1,without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen .
1,"excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jv players ."
1,"remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s ."
1,"unlike some of the other people who received a "" lemon "" , my dvd player came in perfect working condition ."
1,"as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine ."
1,this player seems to work fine with everything else .
1,it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .
1,apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw ) .
1,"i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price ."
1,most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy .
1,this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve .
1,"i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched ! ."
1,so much packed in a small case and very affordable ! .
1,"it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up ."
1,"basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n 't used ."
1,"so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine ."
1,"the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good ."
1,"it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something ."
1,i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation .
1,there are a lot of things i like about it .
1,received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector .
1,so far the dvd works so i hope it does n 't break down like the reviews i 've read .
1,amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .
1,retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display .
1,it works great .
1,"the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and so om not so good , but my feeling at this time is "" two thumbs up "" ! ."
1,"it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much ."
1,"the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling ."
1,amazon is awesome ! .
1,"for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player ."
1,it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .
1,and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .
1,i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there .
1,the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand .
1,i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy .
1,"besides the one problem , this machine is amazing ! ."
1,"it plays everything , even vcd 's ."
1,"i will never use all the "" whistles and bells "" this machine is capable of ."
1,but for what i do use it is perfect .
1,owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide .
1,the dvd player is fine .
1,"of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents ."
1,"the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv ."
1,"but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there ."
1,the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough .
1,"there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote ."
1,i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .
1,i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine .
1,"still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features ! ."
1,this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it .
1,"ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all"
1,good looks
1,this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player .
1,i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it ! .
1,apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .
1,"also , very light and portable ."
1,it will read and play all cd audio disc .
1,i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .
1,it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs .
1,"also , it was only $ 39 . 99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player ."
1,good quality video .
1,it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine .
1,mixed bag i guess but the price was right .
1,this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .
1,"the build quality feels solid , it does n 't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dots and dd5 . 1 sound good ) ."
1,"it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims ."
1,i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .
1,i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n 't had any problems .
1,"there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc ."
1,"so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price ! ."
1,"noiseless , lightweight and oh yeah ."
1,works great ! .
1,silverfish color really adds a special touch .
1,it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . )
1,"either way , can 't go wrong with this price ."
1,i am really impressed by this dvd player .
1,"for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds ."
1,no matter the format .
1,i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .
1,"the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group ."
1,they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thus far ) .
1,a few of my work constituents owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .
1,i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no vi sable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .
1,"bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices ."
1,i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .
1,"this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is ! ."
1,"just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( almost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance ."
1,"whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together ."
1,overall i 'm happy with my toy .
1,"in a word , "" awesome "" is how i would describe this camera ."
1,"i wo n 't go into the details here , as the online sites ( steve's digicams , previews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers ."
1,"with the automatic settings , i really have n 't taken a bad picture yet ."
1,"i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 ."
1,i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .
1,i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality .
1,"the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds ."
1,"despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography ."
1,i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .
1,the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .
1,"1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its program and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n 't want to bother with the settings ."
1,excellent range of metering options as well .
1,it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .
1,2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )
1,3 ) 4x zoom is nice
1,5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .
1,"you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus ."
1,the camera has a wonderful set of features .
1,the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
1,the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
1,the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
1,"i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased ."
1,"the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use ."
1,the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .
1,it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
1,recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .
1,advanced photo bugs will find more creative control than imaginable .
1,newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .
1,4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
1,those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
1,the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
1,i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period ! .
1,"it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing ."
1,i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
1,"this camera has canon 's great calorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get ."
1,the prints are beautiful ! .
1,"although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon ."
1,this is a great camera for you ! .
1,"the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an "" auto "" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use ."
1,"i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus ."
1,"i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers ."
1,"but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive ! ."
1,"with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality ."
1,the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .
1,this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .
1,"you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy ."
1,"the more i work with it , the more i love it ! ."
1,i did n 't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase ! .
1,"this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it ."
1,"seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want ."
1,"but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in "" auto "" mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it ! ."
1,four megapixels is great .
1,it is a very amazing product .
1,i highly recommend it .
1,just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .
1,takes excellent photos .
1,night mode is clear as day .
1,"i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it ."
1,overall it is the best camera on the market .
1,"a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging -- - how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )"
1,i love this camera .
1,took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
1,"great colors , pictures and white balance ."
1,has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
1,"when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n 't moving , the photos were awesome ."
1,the camera was a marvel .
1,it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .
1,"i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images ."
1,what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
1,"fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the met 60 ct-4 ."
1,"contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon ."
1,what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
1,"without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image ! ."
1,but at least you re starting with the most photo realistic images ive ever seen from a camera .
1,"i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits ."
1,"i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision ."
1,this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
1,"battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k . reeves ."
1,"manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding ."
1,the service from the supplier was exceptional .
1,"having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos ."
1,"by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stop action photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced ."
1,"the camera is a dream to operate in auto mode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes ."
1,i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera ! .
1,but canon never fails to amaze .
1,1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
1,"2 . battery life is over 4 . 5 hours , compared to about 2 . 5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikon's ."
1,3 . the remote capture and file viewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .
1,"4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking ."
1,the light auto-correction is awesome .
1,you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .
1,"8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets ."
1,"overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view ."
1,this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
1,"4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! . )"
1,the powershot g3 is a great camera .
1,because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos ! .
1,"4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera ."
1,it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
1,this is my first digital camera and i could n 't be happier .
1,i love the quality of the pictures .
1,they look fantastic .
1,the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
1,"with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots ."
1,i love the es based controls and easy menus .
1,"i bought it for my trip to buns aries , and also used it at the iguassu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance ! ."
1,"this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it ! ."
1,another point of note : the battery life is incredible ! .
1,am i ever glad that i decided on this camera ! .
1,"i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy ."
1,very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .
1,the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
1,"the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom ."
1,the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
1,because this camera is beautiful .
1,the g3 looks like a work of art ! .
1,"its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen ."
1,i am very pleased with it so far .
1,it is very simple to import via photo 2 and then move them to photoshop .
1,i am quite happy with the camera .
1,it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
1,"yes , i recommend it over the competition ."
1,"best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything ."
1,"this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website ."
1,"first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's ."
1,this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .
1,"however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice ."
1,"it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing ! ."
1,"also , the display is "" hinged "" and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage ."
1,another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
1,i have owned this camera for a short time and would n 't give it up for anything .
1,it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera . .
1,in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
1,it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
1,the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .
1,"in the hands of someone who does n 't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode ."
1,the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .
1,canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
1,learning how to use it will not take very long .
1,the image quality is excellent .
1,range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
1,this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
1,the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
1,this camera is closest to perfect than any other diagram that is 4-5 megapixel .
1,i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ; .
1,"in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great ! ."
1,the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; . there are tons of features i have n 't even gotten to .
1,"i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind ."
1,the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .
1,"it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid ."
1,everything else about the camera is great .
1,"if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera ."
1,"and so far , i 've been very pleased ."
1,"the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer ."
1,the moveable lcd screen is great .
1,"the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures ."
1,the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
1,"i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :"
1,"the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery ."
1,"i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperture priority , light metering adjustments , etc . , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear ."
1,"i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files ."
1,i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .
1,"very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price ."
1,i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .
1,"all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market ."
1,canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .
1,"simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point ."
1,the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .
1,"even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 ."
1,definitely a great camera .
1,proven canon built quality and lens .
1,feels solid in hand .
1,we really enjoyed shooting with the canon powershot sd500 .
1,it has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point-and-shoot we 've ever tested .
1,"a digic ii-powered image-processing system enables the sd500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip , its start-up time is tops in its class , and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition ."
1,the sd500 rivals the canon g6 in image quality .
1,this camera is truely superb .
1,"the startup time , quality of pictures and videos is outstanding ."
1,they say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact .
1,i went out and got the canon today .
1,"i 've taken about hundred shot with the canon , in varying lighting situations , all in auto mode , and not one blurry picture ! . ! . ! ."
1,"i did not conduct a rigorous test , but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras , and the canon won hands down ."
1,sharper pictures .
1,"the canon is very small , definitely pocket size , but still easy to hold firmly ."
1,"it powers up quickly , so you won 't miss that quick shot ."
1,good image quality .
1,"all i have to say is that the pics i get with my sd500 are both rich and color and high in detail , the user interface is awesome , the battery charger is tiny and super light and sd cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time ."
1,camera is a paper weight .
1,i have been very impressed with my purchase of the sd500 i bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it .
1,"the pictures are tack sharp , colors are vivid , and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire ."
1,"powerup is quick , and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on ."
1,"i have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode , while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera , its quality easily surpasses that of my old hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe ( max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card ) ."
1,"audio is mono and fairly acceptable , quiet also with little distortions ."
1,the battery life is not that of the casio 's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opinion with the battery life you've got .
1,glad to see the ed . revised the previous statements regarding image quality .
1,"my sd500 focuses flawlessly , does not "" whine "" during video , and my pictures are razor sharp ."
1,this camera is bulletproof .
1,start up is so quick
1,you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on . . . literally ! .
1,"big lcd screen - at least for me , 2 "" is enough"
1,"great picture quality - in automatic mode , quality is great ."
1,"when you learn how to change some settings , you can make the quality even better"
1,"digital zoom is clear too . . . say you used all 3x optical zoom , try to do digital zoom then . . . just try not to shake the camera at all and you 'll still get a clear good quality picture"
1,great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one ( canon a60 ( ? . ) . . . the 2 . 0 megapixel one ) .
1,"i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips , i give it 5/5 stars = ) oh and btw , while you take video clips , you can zoom it too ! . ( digital zoom only though ) . . . but still . . . ( my old one can 't do that . . . you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip . )"
1,photo stitch ( merge pictures to create a panoramic one . . even my old one can do this and it 's really cool to have it now still )
1,turn the camera on while pressing the button ( or is it the menu button ? . i have to check again = ) ) and it 'l show you the time and date .
1,i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures .
1,"if you 'll only read the whole manual , you 'll find out even more cool features and you 'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading"
1,it 's such a great camera ! . i think it really was worth the investment = )
1,"if you haven 't noticed , they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer ."
1,they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don 't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self-timer .
1,"i bought this camera two days ago , and i 'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money ."
1,"if you on the other hand always use automatic settings ( and not manual ) you should be just fine , as the camera features some of the best automatic settings i have ever seen ."
1,"all in all , this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price ."
1,having the digic ii chip helps a lot .
1,this camera takes amazing pictures and its size can not be beat .
1,i still can 't believe how fast it starts up .
1,i take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice .
1,"i still have my s70 because i like the wider lens sometimes , but in general , if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package , the sd500 is the only one you should buy ."
1,"i love the rounded edges now , fits so much better in a pocket , jeans or suit ."
1,"i tell you now , after lot of shooting in many different situations , this camera is amazing ."
1,the size of the camera is perfect .
1,fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket .
1,there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things .
1,"i like to take pictures when i go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso 's but i don 't really care that much , i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality ."
1,the flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent .
1,i 'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera .
1,"this camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact , take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot ."
1,the instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep .
1,"i 've only had this camera for a few days , but it 's been great ."
1,the photo quality is amazing .
1,"it 's fast , feels great in your hand and looks great too ."
1,i 've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views .
1,as any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had simone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image appeared on the decently sized screen .
1,another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera .
1,"moreover , apart from the plastic cable cover , the camera has a nice , solid feel about it , and it 's so tiny , i take it with me wherever i go ."
1,"as it turns out , this is an awesome camera ! ."
1,"however , this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes ."
1,the sd500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed .
1,"bottom line , this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck ! ."
1,"i don 't know why cnet says there is a problem with focus , i have all my pictures sharp and high quality ."
1,"very good "" every day "" camera . fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos ."
1,"if you want a sharp looking , fast digital camera and you don 't need or want manual controls , then this is the camera for you ! ."
1,am so glad i bought this camera .
1,all the good reviews for the sd500 are true .
1,the view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer .
1,the included software removes any red eye easily .
1,"if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket , take great pics and video , get the sd500 ."
1,this is overall the best point and shoot camera i 've used .
1,placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect .
1,i also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact ps cameras since it 's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot .
1,"overall build quality , good macros-results , impressive video-quality , good pictures with flash ( good colours , sharp results ) , excellent auto white balance ."
1,"could be better to be a perfect camera ( and some competitors do some of this better ) : purple fringing , details in high-light area , noise over iso100 , red-eyes , ( few ) processing artefact's , ( few ) loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light , automatic autofocus , whizzing while video-playback , better video compression ( smaller viedo-files ) , more manual controls , longer lasting battery , indicator for battery , better protection of the lcd , less weight ."
1,"when the overall image quality ( especially natural colours , details , natural looking of the pictures ) is the most important thing , then this camera its top notch and very impressive ."
1,"in low light with flash i found it clear better then the sony p200 ( too much red , colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes ) ."
1,"i found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus , manual mode , iso 100 ( shorter aperture-time , so more often sharper images as with iso 50 ) , auto white balance ( auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras i have and they already do very-well ) ."
1,i upgraded from a very small 3 . 2 max camera to this camera with great results .
1,good color and very little needed to correct photos on paint shop pro .

1,"a great camera , but here are some points which i don 't notice in most of the reviews here , which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer :"
1,i purchased the elph s100 mainly because i thought it was cool .
1,"the camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great ( not as good as prints from my pro digital camera , but still very good ) ."
1,"but i was ready to upgrade and when i discovered that canon was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher resolution , i had to have the s100 ."
1,"this is my second digital camera , but i 'm much more impressed with the canon s100 digital elph than i ever was with my kodak dc240 ."

1,the good : small size ; . durable-seeming metal case ; . easy to use ; . visually distinctive ; . good picture quality ; . fast usb connection ; . mostly intuitive operation ; . really cool photostitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas .
1,"if compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera , the canon powershot s100 digital elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design ."
1,"the s100 's image quality rates in the middle of its class , but it can still be a reasonable choice for students , families , or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack ."
